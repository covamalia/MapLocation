# MapLocation

.NET Wrapper for various location services to standardise to a simple MapLocation object for multiple providers.

Worked on from time-to-time (mainly in free time) to have some fun with GitHub.

Bear with me if you have a PR, as I'm not normally a Git guy and live my life in TFS/VSTS/Azure Devops (or whatever it's getting called today ðŸ˜Š). Will try and keep this plodding on though
